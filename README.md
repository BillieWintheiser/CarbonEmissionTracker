# Confidential Carbon Emission Tracking Platform

A revolutionary blockchain-based solution for transparent and privacy-preserving carbon emission monitoring using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology.

## Project Overview

This platform enables companies to securely track, report, and verify their carbon emissions while maintaining complete data confidentiality. Built on advanced cryptographic principles, it provides regulatory compliance without compromising sensitive business information.

## Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Smart Contracts

Our system leverages cutting-edge FHE technology to enable:
- **Encrypted Data Processing**: Perform calculations on encrypted emission data without revealing the underlying values
- **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Verify compliance and generate reports while keeping actual emission figures private
- **Confidential Computations**: Compare, aggregate, and analyze emission data while maintaining complete privacy

### Confidential Carbon Emission Tracking

The platform implements a comprehensive three-scope emission tracking system:

#### Scope 1: Direct Emissions
- Direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company
- Fuel combustion, company vehicles, manufacturing processes
- Encrypted storage ensures competitive sensitivity protection

#### Scope 2: Indirect Emissions
- Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling
- Supply chain energy consumption tracking
- Privacy-preserved energy audit capabilities

#### Scope 3: Supply Chain Emissions
- All other indirect emissions across the value chain
- Vendor and supplier emission integration
- Confidential supply chain impact assessment

### Privacy-Protected Environmental Data

Our platform addresses critical privacy concerns in environmental reporting:

- **Business Intelligence Protection**: Emission data often reveals production levels, operational efficiency, and strategic information
- **Competitive Advantage Preservation**: Companies can comply with regulations without exposing trade secrets
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet environmental disclosure requirements while maintaining data confidentiality
- **Stakeholder Trust**: Provide verifiable environmental performance without compromising business operations
